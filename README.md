# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction

A machine learning project to predict crop yield (production output) based on environmental and agricultural factors such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, and crop type.  
The goal is to help farmers, researchers, and policymakers make **data-driven decisions** for sustainable agriculture.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Data preprocessing (handling categorical & numerical features).  
- 🌦️ Uses climate and agricultural parameters (rainfall, temperature, pesticides, etc.).  
- 🤖 Trains machine learning models to predict crop yield.  
- 📈 Evaluates model performance with metrics (R², RMSE, etc.).  
- 🧩 Supports future integration with real-time agricultural datasets.

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Dataset (`yield_df.csv`) includes crop yield data and environmental features such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, year, country, and crop type.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and trends using **heatmaps, bar plots, and distribution plots**.  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Dropped irrelevant columns and handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical variables using **Label/One-Hot Encoding**  
   - Standardized numerical features using **ColumnTransformer**  

4. **Model Training & Selection**  
   - Tested multiple regression models  
   - **Decision Tree Regressor** selected as the final model  
   - Achieved **high accuracy** in predicting crop yields  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: **R² Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE**  
   - Strong predictive performance on test data  
## 📊 Results
- **Final Model:** Decision Tree Regressor  
- **Test Accuracy:** 97% predictive accuracy  
- **Impact:** Enables interactive crop yield prediction for better decision-making
