# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction

A machine learning project to predict crop yield (production output) based on environmental and agricultural factors such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, and crop type.  
The goal is to help farmers, researchers, and policymakers make **data-driven decisions** for sustainable agriculture.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Data preprocessing (handling categorical & numerical features).  
- 🌦️ Uses climate and agricultural parameters (rainfall, temperature, pesticides, etc.).  
- 🤖 Trains machine learning models to predict crop yield.  
- 📈 Evaluates model performance with metrics (R², RMSE, etc.).  
- 🧩 Supports future integration with real-time agricultural datasets.
